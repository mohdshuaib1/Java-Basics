JVM-- JVM stands for JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE
      When we write a program it can be saved with its name (.java) 
          Ex- firstprograme.java
              after saving the program it can be compiled into the (.class) & (.class), which is called BYTECODE


                    [.java] --> COMPILE -->  [.class] 
                                                :.:
                                                :.:
                                                 .
                                  (.class) also named as BYTE code

NOTE :::: THROUGH THE JVM OUR BYTECODE HAS BEEN RUN.
